# CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars using machine learning techniques. We will follow a structured process to analyze the data, clean it, and build models to make predictions.

## Project Workflow

1. **Understanding Problem Statement**
   - Define the goal of the project.
   - Identify the target variable (price) and input variables (features such as age, mileage, brand, etc.).
   
2. **Getting System Ready**
   - Setting up the environment with necessary libraries and tools (e.g., Python, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.).

3. **Data Collection**
   - Collect the dataset of used cars, either from a source like CarDekho or a publicly available dataset.
   
4. **Understanding the Data**
   - **Data Eyeballing**: Initial overview of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - **Data Description**: Descriptive statistics and summary information of the dataset.

5. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing I**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Removing or imputing incorrect/outlier data.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding relationships and patterns in the dataset.

   - **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual features.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between two variables (e.g., price vs mileage).
   - **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigating the relationships between multiple features.

7. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing II**
   - Further data preparation after insights gained from EDA.
   - Encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
   - Feature transformation if required.

8. **Insights from Data Visualization**
   - Visual representation of data trends and relationships using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

9. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features or modifying existing features to improve model performance.

10. **Model Building & Evaluation**
    - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), RÂ², etc.

11. **Selection of Best Model & Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - Use cross-validation and grid search/random search to fine-tune the best model.

12. **Generating Pickle File**
    - Once the best model is selected, serialize it as a `pickle` file for future use in predictions.
